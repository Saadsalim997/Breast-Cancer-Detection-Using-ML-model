Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set ML Models
This repository contains two machine learning models trained on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set.

Models
Model 1: Logistic Regression
File: Saad_model_v1.py
Description: This model classifies breast cancer as malignant or benign using logistic regression. It preprocesses the data by standardizing the features and then trains a logistic regression classifier.
Model 2: Decision Tree
File: Saad_model_v2.py
Description: This model also classifies breast cancer as malignant or benign, but uses a decision tree classifier. It preprocesses the data similarly to the logistic regression model.

Dataset
The dataset used for training both models is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, which is publicly available at the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Instructions
Model 1: To run the logistic regression model, execute Saad_model_v1.py.
Model 2: To run the decision tree model, execute Saad_model_v2.py.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
